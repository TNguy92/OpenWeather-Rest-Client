REST Client


Develop a Python script that will get the current weather data for a particular zip code and then
print out some of that data in a table. The site OpenWeatherMap provides a simple REST API to
get weather data. Use the zip code assigned below.
For the zip code 30144, the output would be:


Name: KSU
Current Temperature: 64.5 degrees Fahrenheit
Atmospheric Pressure: 992.52 hPa
Wind Speed 10.6 mph
Wind Direction 289.5
Time of Report 2017-03-10 11:13:24


To be able to carry out this assignment you will need to register for a free account with
OpenWeatherMap. You will provide an id (username) when registering. Once you have
registered, you will receive an APIID, essentially your password for using the service.
The current weather data API page tells you how to create a request for the current weather at a
particular zip code. Information on the page tells the structure of the data returned. The How to
start page tells how to include the APIID and id in a request. Unless you care to convert from
Kelvin to degrees Fahrenheit and convert from kilometers per hour to miles per hour in your
script, be sure to request ‘imperial’ units from the server.
The data you get back will be encoded as JSON. You will need to decode it to access the
information contained in the response.


Use the datetime class in the datetime package from the standard library to convert the time
stamp included in the data to readable form. The value included in the data is the number of
seconds since the epoch (standard Unix timestamp). The displaye
